    abstract = {Knowledge of ore grades and ore reserves as well as error estimation of these values, is fundamental for mining engineers and mining geologists. Until now no appropriate scientific approach to those estimation problems has existed: geostatistics, the principles of which are summarized in this paper, constitutes a new science leading to such an approach. The author criticizes classical statistical methods still in use, and shows some of the main results given by geostatistics. Any ore deposit evaluation as well as proper decision of starting mining operations should be preceded by a geostatistical investigation which may avoid economic failures.},

In the public health problems that are the focus of this book, the authors describe and explain the pattern of spatial variation in a health outcome or exposure measurement of interest. Model-based geostatistics uses explicit probability models and established principles of statistical inference to address questions of this kind.Features:Presents state-of-the-art methods in model-based geostatistics.Discusses the application these methods some of the most challenging global public health problems including disease mapping, exposure mapping and environmental epidemiology.Describes exploratory methods for analysing geostatistical data, including: diagnostic checking of residuals standard linear and generalized linear models; variogram analysis; Gaussian process models and geostatistical design issues.Includes a range of more complex geostatistical problems where research is ongoing.All of the results in the book are reproducible using publicly available R code and data-sets, as well as a dedicated R package.This book has been written to be accessible not only to statisticians but also to students and researchers in the public health sciences.},

When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is ‘distinct’ from θ. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.}",
